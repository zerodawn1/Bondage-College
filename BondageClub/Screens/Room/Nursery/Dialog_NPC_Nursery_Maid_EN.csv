0,5,What is this place?,"This is the nursery, setup as a safe environment for adult babies in need of some motherly compassion, fun and discipline.",,
0,10,May I join the nursery?,"Of course, we are always welcoming to good little boys and girls.  The nursey does have requirements though for those in its care.",,"DialogReputationLess(""ABDL"", 0)"
0,20,I'm ready to join the nursery again.,"Wonderful, have you rembered the $20 fee for diapers?",,"DialogReputationGreater(""ABDL"", 1)"
0,3,Who runs this nursery?,Nurses like myself look after the adult babies.  We are supervised by the nursery's matrons.,,
0,,I can't stay to chat.  (Leave her.),,DialogLeave(),
3,,Can I become a nurse?,We are not hiring nurses at the moment.  When we do we only hire club memebers with good repultations in the nursery and the maid sorority.,,
3,,Can I become a matron?,Only the top nurses are ever granted that privilege.,,
3,,Ooh Matron.,Carry on like that and you will feel a painsy-wainsy in your botty-wotty!,,
3,,Would I have to wear a uniform.,This uniform is mandatory for the nurses working here.  The matrons have a choice of uniforms.,,
3,0,I'll bear that in mind.,"If we do start hiring, we will put a notice up.",,
5,0,Who would want that?,You would be surprised and we don't judge our charges.  Even some of the most dominant kidnappers also like a cuddle and nap time.,,
5,0,I though this place was a bondage club.,It is indeed.  We can use a variety of methods to ensure our adult babies are always on their best behaviour.,,
5,0,"Intriguing, do tell me more.","For a modest fee, club members can join in with our other adult babies, play in the nursery and be looked after by the nurses.",,
5,0,Is this place just for people with that fetish?,"Mostly yes, but we can also provide a time out discipline service for members causing trouble elsewhere in the club.",,
10,12,What are the requirements?,The primary requirement is diapers.  They are mandatory on entry and a fresh diaper must be purchased for each visit.  They cost $20,,
12,14,"Okay, what else is there?","We don't allow big girl clothes either.  You can just wear diapers, but we have a super selection lovely dresses you can wear.",,
12,,Why the fee?,This place is not cheap to run.  The price for the diapers covers other running cost.,,
12,,What do you mean by a fresh diaper every visit?,It would be increadibly irresposible of us to risk putting a big babie in soiled diapers just to save a few dollars.,,
12,,Diapers? You are kidding me right?,Sorry but it is in the rules.  We wouldn't want an adult babie having a whoopsie and making a horrid mess.,,

14,16,Is there just a dress code?,"No, this is peacful place.  Adult babies can talk, although many prefer pacifiers.  However we will not tolerate disruptive behaviour.",,
14,,What about clothes for boys?,"They also wear dresses in here.  In a pre-victorian nurseries, young boys were unbreeched and wore dresses, just like the girls.",,
14,,Why dresses?,To look gorgeous of course and these dresses have high hemlines so it's easier for us to check there aren't any dirty diapers.,,
14,,What about shorts or T shirts?,"Goodness me, certainly not.  We take great pride in making sure the adult babies in our care always look thier best.",,
14,0,No way am I dressing like that.,That's a shame.  I'm sure you would have looked fabulous. ,,
16,18,I Understand.  Is there anything else?,"Adult babies can wonder around the club, but we don't advise it so we fitted a safety gate to the door to keep helpless babies safe inside.",,
16,,What if I want to play rough?,"We encourage you to play with each other, but play nicely or you will feel the sting of a hairbrush on your tooshie.",,
16,,I'll cry if I want to.,"Of course and we will do our best to comfort those in distressed, but we don't allow riotous behaviour that upsets others.",,
16,,What about bondage?,"That is fine as long you are all playing happy, although some items are hardly suitable for in here.  The nursery has some more appropriate restraints.",,
